## Summary
This project was completed before I knew about CSS GRID and I honestly wish I had learned it before this! The most difficult part was definitely the alignment of the photo to the right. It would've been simple with GRID but I had a bunch of trouble with CSS. A lot of videos and stack overflow searches helped me with this alignment. 

The actual form validation was simple on this project. I tried to get a little fancy by adding in some CSS for typing into the form but it didn't quite come out how I wanted. I will revisit this project in the future and hopefully have a better grasp on form styling. 

### What I learned

- Gained a better understanding of **HTML** ans **CSS** foundations and form validation. 
- Practiced aligning images and content seperately on a webpage. 
- Utilized StackOverflow ad Youtube to help align items within containers and styling form inputs.  
- I used [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for the form image.
